To **open Excalidraw (Excalibrain)** inside **Obsidian** on Linux, you first need to know the difference between the two related plugins:

- 🧠 **Excalibrain** → A _graph-like mind map_ view of your notes (inspired by Obsidian’s Graph View + Excalidraw visuals).
    
- ✏️ **Excalidraw** → A _drawing canvas_ plugin for sketches, diagrams, and hand-drawn notes.sds
    

Let’s go step-by-step for **Excalibrain**, assuming you already have Obsidian installed.

## 🧩 Step 1: Install the Excalibrain Plugin

1. Open **Obsidian**.
    
2. Go to **Settings → Community plugins**.
    
3. Turn **Safe mode** off (if it’s on).
    
4. Click **Browse**, then search for **Excalibrain**.
    
5. Click **Install**, then **Enable**.

## 🧠 Step 2: Open Excalibrain View

Once installed:

- Press **Ctrl + P** (to open Command Palette).
    
- Type **“Excalibrain”**.
    
- Choose **“Open Excalibrain view”**.
    

Alternatively:

- Click on the **Excalibrain icon** (🧠) in the left sidebar, if visible.
    
- It will open a pane showing a _visual knowledge graph_ of your linked notes.

## ⚙️ Step 3: Configure It (Optional)

You can adjust how it behaves:

- Go to **Settings → Excalibrain**.
    
- Configure node types, link filters, colors, etc.
    
- It works best if your notes use **[[wikilinks]]** or **dataview fields**.

## 🖼️ (Optional) Step 4: Use with Excalidraw

If you also have **Excalidraw** installed:

- You can use **Excalibrain** to visualize and **Excalidraw** to _draw diagrams manually_.
    
- Both integrate well for “visual thinking” inside Obsidian.

Would you like me to explain how to **link Excalibrain with your existing note structure** (so it automatically visualizes your “topics” or “projects” as nodes)?
